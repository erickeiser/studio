/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Gridiron Genius.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for playbooks and plays.
 * Only authenticated users can create, read, update, or delete their own playbooks and plays.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * Data is nested under /users/{userId}, creating a clear ownership hierarchy.
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles.
 * - /users/{userId}/playbooks/{playbookId}: Playbooks owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/playbooks/{playbookId}/plays/{playId}: Plays within a playbook.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only manage their own data (playbooks and plays).
 * - Listing other users' playbooks or plays is prohibited.
 * - Data consistency between path and document data is enforced on create and update.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * Authorization is based on the path; no denormalization is needed.
 * The path-based approach provides a simple and efficient way to manage access control.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * All user-specific data (playbooks and plays) is stored under the /users/{userId} path,
 * ensuring clear separation and preventing accidental public access.
